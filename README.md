A toy decentralized asset trading system.

>A decentralized asset trading system is a way to buy and sell digital assets (like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies) directly with other people, without going through a >middleman like Coinbase or Binance.

>Imagine you want to trade your Pokémon cards. In a regular system, you’d go to a shop, hand over your card, and the shop would find someone who wants to buy it. The shop >charges a fee and handles everything for you.

>In a decentralized system, there’s no shop. Instead, you’d use a “digital marketplace” where you can directly find other people who want to trade with you. This marketplace >runs on a shared network (called a blockchain), which keeps track of who owns what, securely and transparently. Since there’s no middleman, you have more control, you pay >lower fees, and trades are usually safer from hacking, because they’re spread out across many computers instead of being in one central place.
